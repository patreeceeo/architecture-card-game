_Congratulations! You have a new-to-you house in [INSERT FAKE NEIGHBORHOOD + TOWN NAME HERE]. Your neighbors sure are a bunch of characters too. Not everything is perfect for you and your character, though. The house is… a bit of a fixer-upper. And your character has dreams of what they like best in a home._

_It’s up to you to turn this house into your character’s dream home, and work with neighbors to make the whole street a destination to brag about_


## Game Objective

# SETUP:

1. _First, you’ll want to know what kind of character you are and what kind of house you own. _

    Draw one (1) Character card and one (1) Site card. Place these on your Project Folder.

2. _Next, time to assess your house’s state of (dis)repair. Look out! Leaving this unattended for too long could cause more damage down the road._

    Roll 2 6-sided die 3 times to determine what’s broken. Refer to the table below

3. _Now it’s time to gather up your resources to start sprucing things up!_

    Draw 6 cards from the main deck - This will be your starting hand of resources and projects to play from during your turn.





# PLAYING THE GAME

**Who Goes First: **First person to share a story about their residence goes first! Some prompts below:



* What do you want to change most about your current residence?
* What do you like about your neighborhood?
* Has something broken in your home? How hard was it to fix? What did you have to do?
* Have you tried a DIY project before? How did it go?
* Did you ever go to someone’s home and think, “this is a dream home”? What was the place like?
* Would you rather build walls, tinker with electrical systems, garden, or decorate if you had to spruce up a place? Something else?


## Gameplay

Going clockwise, players take turns, making as many upgrades or repairs as they can each turn. Combine projects with their required resources to play them and improve your house. You can play multiple projects at once (see card explanations below). When a project has been played, the project card(s) and their resources are discarded into the Discard pile. Place tokens on the part of the house the project touched showing the victory points from that project.

**Projects with Permits:** A player can play up to one Construction Permit card and up to one Planning Permit card per turn. A single permit card can be used for multiple upgrades or repairs. 

**Projects with Drawings: **A player can play as many architecture or engineering drawings as they want during their turn. Each Drawing Card only counts for one project. (More stuff to change means more stuff to draw!)

**Voting: **Some projects require neighbors to vote on if a project can proceed. Other players should base their votes on how their character might vote. The player trying to make the upgrade can state their case, make deals with other players, or trade/give cards in exchange for a “yes” vote. Majority rules.



* If “yes” project proceeds. Player plays project like any other project
* If “no” the relevant in-play cards return to the player’s hand. Player can try to play a different project (or a version of that project that does not require a vote) in that same turn if they wish.
* A tie is handled the same as a “no” outcome.

**Trading:** During a player’s turn, they can make trades with other players. A player may trade cards as many times as they want.

**Exchange with Draw Pile:** A player can discard one card and draw one new card during their turn.

**Special Ability:** A player may use their character’s Special Ability once per turn. Follow instructions on your Character Card under SPECIAL ABILITY.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rolling for Damage</span>**

Roll 2 6-sided dice when rolling for damage.

If you roll a 6 or lower, you take the damage and consequences.

If you roll a 7 or higher, no damage is taken

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Other Damage Effects</span>**

During the game, you may experience other types of damage to your home as a result of neglecting to address existing damage.

POISON: Your house has become moldy and is affecting your household’s health! Place a poison icon on your house. You lose 1VP for every turn that you have the poison icon on your house.

ENERGY SINK: Something is making a huge spike in your energy bill. Place an energy sink icon on your house. You lose 1VP for every turn that you have the energy sink icon on your house.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">End Turn:</span>** At the end of a player’s turn, that player draws two cards from the main deck. If a player has more than 6 cards in their hand, they must discard after drawing until they have 6 cards.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">End of Round: Event Cards</span>**

At the end of each round, when all players have taken their turn, the group draws an Event Card. Everyone in the group is affected by this event and must follow the instructions on the card.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">End of Game: Losing (One Player)</span>**

If you reach 10 damage tokens on your house, your house has fallen into so much disrepair that it is deemed Condemned. Your character cannot keep up with repairs and must sell the house. You are out of the game. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">End of Game for Everyone</span>**

When a player has completed their repairs at the end of their turn, all players complete the current round and the game ends. Instead of drawing an event card, players tally their points. For every repair not made, dock the damage amount from your victory points.



**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">CARD MANAGEMENT</span>**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Draw Deck and Discard Pile</span>**

Main deck cards (not event cards, site cards, or character cards) are shuffled into a Draw Deck. When players discard cards, discard into a separate Discard Pile. When the Draw Deck is empty, shuffle the cards in the Discard Pile and that becomes the new Draw Deck.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">In Play Items</span>**

Cards + items that are placed on your folder. Your house, your site card, your character card, and all played upgrades and current damaged areas are your In Play items.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Your Hand</span>**

Cards in your hand are not in play. They can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand”. At the end of your turn, you may have no more than six (6) cards in your hand and must discard any extra cards.
